    <p>Our objectives here are to define setter injection of a dependency in an XML
        configuration file. Get a Spring Managed Bean and its dependencies, attached
        to it by the object graph out of the Application Context.
        <br>And then we'll look at another form of injection called Constructor
        Injection, and how we can configure that.</p>
