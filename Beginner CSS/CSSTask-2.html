    <p>A new fund launched in advance of GiveDay, on Thursday, April 18,
        will enable students from Afghanistan to experience a life-changing
        University of Lynchburg education. Launching the Afghanistan Student
        Education Fund is the first step toward supporting young Afghan women
        and opens the door for donors to invest in this powerful opportunity.</p>
    <p>As with all scholarships and funds, there is no application process for
        receiving these funds. And no funds will be awarded to qualifying Afghan
        students until the ASEF is fully funded — a goal the school hopes to reach
        by the 2025-26 academic year. </p>
    <p>GiveDay will also provide opportunities for individuals to make their gifts
        to the fund go even further. “Several alumni have already stepped up to
        offer a generous match,” said Kerry Kinnison, major gifts officer at the
        University.</p>
